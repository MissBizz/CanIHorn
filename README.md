# CanIHorn
This addon is for Elder Scrolls Online to tell you whether a warhorn is active within your group or not.

# How It Works
Can I Horn only works while you are in a group.
If there are no warhorns active on you or your group members, the text will be green and read "Warhorn not active". When someone uses a warhorn ability, the text will change to red and read "Warhorn is Active". The text can be moved to anywhere on your screen.

# Why
I created this addon as a way to help healers and tanks know when they can use their warhorn after the last person. Red text meaning "stop, do not use yours!" and green text meaning "go ahead and use warhorn!" to help overcome overlapping warhorns.
# Known Issues
This addon can only track the Sturdy morph of warhorn if you receive the buff yourself. Unmorphed Warhorn and Aggressive warhorn are tracked even if you don't receive the buff (maybe you were too far away at the time)
